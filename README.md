# HexConverter

This can be useful when you need to represent a string address in a format commonly used in programming and debugging, especially in scenarios like shellcode development or memory analysis.

How to Use:

    Compile the Program: Compile the HexConverter program using a C compiler like GCC. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   

gcc -o HexConverter HexConverter.c

Replace "HexConverter.c" with the name of your source code file if it's different.

Run the Program: After successful compilation, you can run the program by executing the following command:


./HexConverter

Enter Your Input: When the program runs, it will prompt you to enter the string you want to convert. Type the desired string and press Enter.

View the Converted String: The program will then display the input string in the hexadecimal "\x" format. For example:



    Enter the string to convert: /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64
    Converted: \x2f\x6c\x69\x62\x36\x34\x2f\x6c\x64\x2d\x6c\x69\x6e\x75\x78\x2d\x78\x38\x36\x2d\x36\x34

    The converted string can be copied and used in your code or debugging sessions as needed.

Note: This program is a basic example for educational purposes.
